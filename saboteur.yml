# This file configures how Saboteur merges pull requests

auth:
  # Saboteur can authenticate against GitHub either using a Personal Access
  # Token, or as a GitHub application.
  #
  # # For app installations:
  #
  # kind: installation
  # appId: 123456
  # installationId: 12345678
  # keyFile: my-app.2023-09-26.private-key.pem
  #
  # # For Personal access tokens:
  # kind: PAT
  # username: my-user
  #
  # # Define the token direction in the config file:
  # token: "secretToken"
  #
  # # Or ask Saboteur to get it from an environment variable:
  # tokenFromEnv: GITHUB_TOKEN

repositories:
  # This is where you tell Saboteur which repositories it should check.
  #
  # Define one key per repository, and the merge rules below:
  #
  # "abustany/saboteur": # repo owner/name
  #   rules:
  #     # All keys on Rule objects are optional, keys that are not specified
  #     # match all values.
  #     - targetBranch: refs/heads/main # only check PRs targeting a specific branch
  #       successfulChecks:             # require some checks to pass before merging
  #         - name: "Check"             # required, name of the job in the workflow file.
  #                                     # If the workflow is called via workflow_dispatch,
  #                                     # name is workflow_name / job_name.
  #           workflowName: "Tests"     # optional, defined in the "name" key of your workflow
  #       labels: # require some labels on the PR
  #         - automerge
